# WorldSimulation
Turn-based simulation of world with many different kinds of animals and plants, where everyone of these have their own behaviour. Simulation can take place on one of two types of fields (square- or hex- shape).  

To add new organism for the world you need to click on some place on the board and select species you want to add.

Currently interface is only in Polish, but more languages could be added in the future.
